# Sklearn-SVM

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification, regression, and outlier detection problems.

The goal of the SVM algorithm is to find the best hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (space with N-number of features) which serves as a clear separator for the input data points.
